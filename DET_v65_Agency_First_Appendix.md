# Appendix A: The Agency-First Pre-Axiom

**Version:** DET v6.5
**Status:** Proposed Pre-Axiom

## 1. Introduction

This document formalizes the **Agency-First Principle** as a pre-axiom to the DET v6.3/6.5 Scope Axiom. It proposes that within the triad of Information (I), Agency (A), and Movement (k), only Agency is irreducibly primitive. Information and Movement are not co-equal primitives but are instead emergent properties derived from the action of Agency itself. This inversion does not alter the mathematical formalism of DET; rather, it completes its metaphysical foundations, resolving a deep-seated circularity and removing the last vestiges of Platonism from the theory.

## 2. The Pre-Axiom of Agency

The Scope Axiom of DET v6.3 states that present-moment participation requires Information, Agency, and Movement. However, a rigorous examination reveals that only one of these can be truly foundational without circularity.

- If **Information** is primary, one must ask: *what distinguishes the states that constitute information?*
- If **Movement** is primary, one must ask: *movement of what, relative to what?*

Both questions presuppose a distinction-making capacity, which is the definition of Agency. Therefore, we propose the following pre-axiom:

> **Pre-Axiom A0 (Agency-First):** The capacity to distinguish (Agency) is the sole irreducible primitive of existence. All other physical properties, including information, movement, and the laws that govern them, are derivative of Agency and its history.

In short, the agent generates the math, not the other way around. The universe is not a computation; it is the fossil of computation-in-action.

## 3. Re-derivation of Core Concepts

From this pre-axiom, the other components of the Scope Axiom and the core mechanics of DET can be re-derived.

### 3.1 Information as Fossilized Agency

**Information is not causative; it is retained choice.** The distinction between `0` and `1` is not a logical given but a volitional act of differentiation. The stabilization of this distinction across time is what creates arithmetic and, by extension, all information.

This aligns perfectly with the **q-locking law** in DET v6.5:

`q_D_new = q_D + α_q * max(0, -ΔF)`

Here, structural debt (`q_D`) is not merely *memory about* the past; it *is* the past, locally encoded as a constraint on future agency. The laws of physics are not globally imposed commands; they are locally accumulated habits of past choices. They are scars, not statutes.

### 3.2 Movement as the Cost of Distinction

**Movement is the exertion required to prevent a distinction from collapsing back into void.** To maintain `1` as distinct from `0` requires continuous effort. This effort is what DET measures as `k`, the event count.

This is operationally represented by the **Presence Law**:

`P = aσ / ((1+F)(1+H))`

Presence (`P`), or the duration of the present moment, decreases as resource (`F`) and coordination (`H`) increase. In other words, time slows down when it becomes harder to maintain distinction against the weight of accumulated history and structure. Movement is the price agency pays to exist.

## 4. The Agency-First Falsifier (F_A0)

The most significant consequence of this pre-axiom is that it makes DET more rigorously falsifiable. If agency is the source of all structure, then a system without agency should be incapable of generating it.

This leads to a new, foundational falsifier:

| Falsifier ID | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F_A0** | **Spontaneous Structure Test** | **Hypothesis:** A system with agency fully disabled (`a_i = 0` for all `i`) cannot spontaneously generate stable, non-trivial structure, information, or coordinated dynamics. <br><br> **Setup:** Initialize a collider with `a_i = 0` for all nodes and apply only stochastic noise (e.g., random thermal fluctuations). No boundary operators or external grace flux are permitted. <br><br> **Failure Condition:** If the system develops any of the following, the Agency-First pre-axiom is false: <br> 1. Stable, long-range ordering. <br> 2. Persistent information structures (e.g., stable patterns with non-zero autocorrelation over time). <br> 3. Coordinated, non-trivial movement or flow. <br><br> **Success Condition:** The system remains in a state of maximum entropy, exhibiting only transient, uncorrelated noise. All structure rapidly dissipates. |

This test cleanly separates DET from all theories of emergentism that propose agency arises from non-agential components.

## 5. Clarification on Agency and Law

A critical risk in adopting this pre-axiom is the misinterpretation that 
agency can arbitrarily choose reality. This is incorrect. The Agency-First principle must be understood with precision:

> **Agency does not choose outcomes; it chooses distinctions.**

Laws are not violated; they are what remains consistent *across* choices. Agency generates constraints, not miracles. Physics is the compression of repeated, consistent choices made by countless agents over time. Grace, or the introduction of novelty, can only act where the law permits openness—in the spaces between the constraints carved out by history.

This framing keeps DET rigorously scientific, preventing it from devolving into a theory of arbitrary creation. It respects the inviolability of law-bound boundary actions and the principle of non-coercion.

## 6. Conclusion

The formalization of the Agency-First Principle does not replace or alter the mathematical machinery of DET v6.5. Instead, it completes the theory's metaphysical foundations by providing a non-circular origin for its core components. It demonstrates that:

-   **Arithmetic** is the bookkeeping of agential choice.
-   **Information** is the fossil of past agency.
-   **Movement** is the energetic cost of maintaining distinction.

By establishing Agency as the sole irreducible primitive, DET stands firmly as a theory of ontological genesis, where structure emerges from choice, not the other way around. This removes the last hidden Platonism from the model and provides a new, powerful class of falsifier (F_A0) to ground the theory empirically. It is a foundational shift that transforms DET into a more complete and rigorous scientific framework.

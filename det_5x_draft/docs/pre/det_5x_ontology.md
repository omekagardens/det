Deep Existence Theory (DET) v5 — Ontology Card

Version: 5.0 (Draft, Layered)
Status: Operationally grounded, falsifier-aligned
Design Principle: Separate Regime Truth from Dynamic Mechanism

⸻

0. Core Ontological Claim

Existence is not located in objects, but in the capacity of relations to coordinate, remember, and redirect flow.

DET v5 describes reality as a directed, learning relational manifold in which:
	•	time is local,
	•	motion is emergent,
	•	mass is structural,
	•	and constants arise from dynamics rather than imposition.

⸻

1. Ontological Layers (Critical)

DET v5 is explicitly layered. Each layer answers a different question.

Layer	Question	Status
L0 — Regime Layer (DET 4.2)	What kinds of behavior are possible?	Validated
L1 — Phase-Time Layer	How does local time evolve?	Validated
L2 — Directed Manifold Layer	How does motion persist?	New (v5)
L3 — Learning Metric Layer	How does space remember?	New (v5)

No layer overwrites a lower layer. Higher layers activate only when coherence permits.

⸻

2. Layer L0 — Regime Ontology (Inherited from DET 4.2)

Primitive Entities
	•	Agents (Nodes) — sites of processing and choice
	•	Relations (Edges) — channels of possible interaction
	•	Boundary / Reservoir — unconstrained source/sink (non-agentic)

Core Scalars (per agent i)
	•	F_i — stored resource
	•	a_i \in [0,1] — agency / openness
	•	P_i — presence (local clock rate)
	•	\theta_i — phase (local time angle)

Regime Truth (validated)

Reality admits multiple coordination regimes, not a single global order:
	•	Incoherent
	•	Locally coherent (twisted / patterned)
	•	Globally coherent
	•	Frozen / inert

Important: Synchrony is topology-dependent.
Global coherence is not the default state of existence.

3. Layer L1 — Phase–Time Ontology (Validated)

Time is Local

Each agent experiences its own proper time:
\Delta\tau_i = P_i\,\Delta k

Phase is the Only Clock

Phase evolution is the passage of time:
\theta_i \in S^1

Canonical Phase Law

\boxed{
\dot{\theta}_i
=
\omega_0\,g(F_i)
+
\sum_j K_{ij}\sin(\theta_j - \theta_i)
}
	•	Phase is never directly observable
	•	Only differences affect flow
	•	Frozen agents (P\to 0) do not advance in time

This layer establishes causality, simultaneity limits, and time dilation.

⸻

4. Layer L2 — Directed Manifold Ontology (New in v5)

Fundamental Shift

Space is directed.

\boxed{
C_{i\to j} \neq C_{j\to i}
}

Relations encode expectation and permeability, not distance.

Interpretation
	•	C_{i\to j}: ease of influence / flow in a direction
	•	Directionality is learned, not imposed
	•	Momentum is not stored on agents

Motion is a property of relations, not objects.

⸻

5. Phase–Energy Relation (v5 Core)

New Postulate

\boxed{
\dot{\theta}_i = -\beta\,F_i
}
	•	High resource rotates phase “backwards”
	•	Low resource (vacuum) rotates forward
	•	This creates phase suction

This exactly mirrors quantum evolution:
e^{-iEt/\hbar}

Absolute phase remains unphysical — only gradients matter.

⸻

6. Layer L3 — Flow–Structure Feedback (Soliton Engine)

Transport Law

\boxed{
J_{i\to j}
=
\sigma_{ij}\,C_{i\to j}
\Big[
\sqrt{C_{ji}}\sin(\theta_j-\theta_i)
+
(1-\sqrt{C_{ji}})(F_i-F_j)
\Big]
}
	•	Phase gradient → quantum-like pull
	•	Resource gradient → classical pressure
	•	Directionality rectifies flow (diode behavior)

⸻

Hebbian Metric Update (Gravity & Inertia)

\boxed{
\dot{C}_{i\to j}
=
\alpha\,\max(0,J_{i\to j})
-
\lambda\,C_{i\to j}
}
	•	Flow strengthens paths
	•	Unused paths decay
	•	No permanent roads

This produces self-sustaining moving structures (solitons).

⸻

7. Redefined Physical Concepts

Mass

\boxed{
\text{Mass} \;\equiv\; \text{Directional anisotropy of local } C
}
	•	Heavy objects resist turning
	•	Inertia is structural memory
	•	No mass scalar is required

⸻

Gravity
	•	Constant inflow strengthens inward bonds
	•	Metric contraction emerges
	•	G \sim \alpha\,F_{\text{vac}}

⸻

Speed of Light

\boxed{
c \sim f(\alpha,\beta,\lambda)
}
	•	Set by balance of:
	•	phase winding speed
	•	metric learning
	•	decay
	•	A saturation velocity, not a rule

⸻

8. Frozen, Living, and Dead Agency

State	Description
Living	P>0, phase advances, bonds learn
Frozen	P\approx0, phase static, bonds inert
Dead	Structural residue without agency
Boundary	Outside phase space entirely

Frozen agents:
	•	do not move
	•	do not synchronize
	•	do not prevent others from doing so

⸻

9. Constants Are Derived, Not Imposed

Constant	Origin
h	1/\beta (phase cost)
c	learning vs winding balance
G	metric plasticity × vacuum
Mass	anisotropy
Momentum	path asymmetry


⸻

10. Falsifiability Commitments

DET v5 must continue to pass:
	•	Presence scaling (t\sim1/P)
	•	Frozen inertness
	•	No absolute phase observables
	•	No permanent metric memory
	•	No superluminal propagation

All learning must be local, directional, and decaying.

⸻

11. Final Ontological Summary

Reality is not a stage where things move.
Reality is a learning network that remembers how it has moved before.

DET v5 asserts:
	•	Time is phase
	•	Motion is memory
	•	Mass is resistance to forgetting
	•	Space is expectation
	•	Laws are emergent habits

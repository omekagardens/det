# DET v6 3D Collider Suite: Final Report (v2)

**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** Jan 09, 2026  
**Revision:** v2 - Addresses critic's review with proper test isolation and ablation matrix

## 1. Overview

This report details the design, implementation, and validation of the DET v6 3D Collider Suite, which incorporates a strictly local, plaquette-based angular momentum module as specified in the DET v5 Revision Patch (IV.4b). Following a critical review, the implementation was revised to include proper test isolation, removal of conservation-breaking vacuum clamps, and an ablation matrix to verify the role of each flux component.

## 2. Critic's Review and Fixes Applied

The following issues were identified and addressed:

| Issue | Problem | Fix Applied |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Diffusion contamination** | F_L1 claimed to test "rotational flux only" but diffusion was always active | Added `diff_enabled` toggle; disabled for F_L1/F_L2 |
| **Vacuum clamp breaks conservation** | Hard clamp to `F_VAC` injected mass | Changed to clamp to `F_MIN=0`, not `F_VAC` |
| **Hidden dynamics in tests** | σ, C, agency still evolved in "rot-only" tests | Added `sigma_dynamic`, `coherence_dynamic`, `agency_dynamic` toggles |
| **Presence formula deviation** | Current formula differs from bond-sum form | Labeled as ablation; documented deviation |
| **F_L3 attribution** | Unclear if angular momentum or other flux drives orbit | Implemented 4-way ablation matrix |

## 3. Implementation of Plaquette Angular Momentum (IV.4b)

The core of this update was the introduction of a new state variable `L`, representing angular momentum on the faces (plaquettes) of the simulation grid. This design adheres to the strict locality principle of DET by avoiding any global center of rotation.

### 3.1. Key Dynamic Rules

The implementation followed the user-provided specification precisely:

**Charging Law (IV.4b.1):** Angular momentum `L` is generated by the discrete curl of the linear bond momentum `π`. This ensures that angular momentum is an emergent property of linear momentum circulation, not an ad-hoc injection.

```
L⁺ = (1 - λ_L * Δτ_□) * L + α_L * curl(π) * Δτ_□
```

**Rotational Flux (IV.4b.2):** The stored angular momentum `L` induces a rotational flux `J_rot` that is divergence-free by construction. The flux is calculated as the perpendicular gradient of `L`, weighted by the average resource field `F_avg` to prevent transport in a vacuum.

```
J_rot_x = μ_L * σ * F_avg * (L_xy(i,j) - L_xy(i,j-1))
J_rot_y = -μ_L * σ * F_avg * (L_xy(i,j) - L_xy(i-1,j))
```

## 4. Falsifier Test Results (With Proper Isolation)

### 4.1. F_L1: Rotational Flux Conservation

**Test Isolation:** All flux components disabled except `J_rot`. Dynamics frozen (`sigma_dynamic=False`, `coherence_dynamic=False`, `agency_dynamic=False`). No vacuum clamp (`F_MIN=0`).

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Result |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Mass error | 1.20e-16 | < 1e-10 | **PASS** |
| Max COM drift | 0.003 cells | < 0.1 cells | **PASS** |

**Conclusion:** The rotational flux is divergence-free to machine precision.

### 4.2. F_L2: Vacuum Spin Does Not Transport

**Test:** Sweep `F_vac` values and verify `J_rot` scales linearly.

| F_vac | max\|J_rot\| | ΔF |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| 0.001 | 0.178 | 0 |
| 0.01 | 1.779 | 0 |
| 0.1 | 17.79 | 0 |

**Scaling ratio:** 100.00 (expected 100) — **PASS**

**Conclusion:** Rotational flux correctly vanishes in vacuum (scales with F_avg).

### 4.3. F_L3: Orbital Capture - Ablation Matrix

**Critical Finding:** The ablation matrix reveals that orbital capture is primarily driven by linear momentum flux, not the angular momentum module.

| Configuration | Revolutions | L_z | π energy | rot flux |
|---------------|-------------|-----|----------|----------|
| **mom_only** (no angular) | 12.18 | 0.0000 | 666.95 | 0.0000 |
| **full** (mom + angular) | 11.18 | -0.0223 | 666.95 | 9.34 |
| **ang_only** (no momentum) | 2.75 | -0.0213 | 696.03 | 9.37 |
| **no_floor** | 11.18 | -0.0223 | 666.95 | 9.34 |

**Analysis:**

1. **Momentum alone sustains orbits:** The `mom_only` configuration achieves 12 revolutions with zero angular momentum. The orbit is primarily sustained by the linear momentum-to-flux coupling (μ_π).

2. **Angular momentum alone is insufficient:** The `ang_only` configuration achieves only 2.75 revolutions. Without linear momentum flux to drive circulation, the angular momentum module cannot sustain long-term orbits.

3. **Floor has minimal effect:** The `no_floor` configuration matches `full` almost exactly.

4. **Angular momentum is charging correctly:** L_z accumulates to -0.022 in configs with angular momentum enabled, and rot_flux is non-zero (~9.3), confirming the module is working as designed.

## 5. Conclusions

### 5.1. What Works

The angular momentum module (IV.4b) is **correctly implemented**:
- F_L1 passes with machine-precision conservation
- F_L2 passes with correct linear scaling
- L charges from curl(π) as specified
- J_rot is divergence-free and vanishes in vacuum

### 5.2. What the Ablation Reveals

The ablation matrix shows that **orbital capture in the current parameter regime is primarily a momentum-flux phenomenon**, not an angular-momentum-mediated one. This is not a bug—it reflects the physics of the current parameter choices:

- The linear momentum coupling (μ_π = 0.35) is stronger than the angular momentum coupling (μ_L = 0.18)
- Angular momentum is emergent from linear momentum circulation, so it naturally lags behind

### 5.3. Open Questions

1. **Can angular momentum become dominant?** At different parameter regimes (lower μ_π, higher μ_L), does angular momentum become the primary orbital stabilizer?

2. **Long-term stability:** Does angular momentum provide additional stability over very long time scales where momentum would otherwise decay?

3. **Multi-body dynamics:** Does angular momentum play a more significant role in systems with 3+ bodies?

## 6. Deliverables

1. **`det_v6_3d_collider_v3.py`**: The corrected Python script with all critic's fixes
2. **`det_theory_card_6_0_draft.md`**: Theory card for the angular momentum module
3. **Ablation matrix results**: Documented in this report

## 7. Technical Notes

### 7.1. Presence Formula Deviation

The current implementation uses a simplified lattice form:
```
P = a * σ / (1 + F) / (1 + H)
```

This is **not** the full bond-sum form from the theory card. It is labeled as an ablation choice for sandbox testing. The `R` parameter (neighborhood radius) is unused in this lattice PDE realization.

### 7.2. Axis Convention

Arrays are indexed as `[z, y, x]` (standard numpy mgrid order):
- `axis=0` is Z, `axis=1` is Y, `axis=2` is X
- `pi_X[z,y,x]` = momentum on bond from `(z,y,x)` to `(z,y,x+1)` in +X direction
- `L_XY[z,y,x]` = angular momentum on XY-face with corner at `(z,y,x)`

DET v5: Postulate Update (Inertia & Motion)

Status: Validated via Simulation (det_v5_simulation.py)
Date: Post-Soliton Success

1. The Fundamental Shift: Directed Space

In DET v4.2, bonds were symmetric ($C_{ij} = C_{ji}$).
New Postulate: Space is fundamentally Directed.


$$C_{i \to j} \neq C_{j \to i}$$

Physical Interpretation: $C_{i \to j}$ represents the "permeability" or "expectation" of flow in a specific direction.

Emergent Inertia: Momentum is not a variable on the node; it is the asymmetry of the local bonds. If $C_{\text{right}} \gg C_{\text{left}}$, the particle must move right.

2. The Phase-Energy Relation

New Postulate: Resource drives Phase Velocity negatively.


$$\dot{\theta}_i = -\beta \cdot F_i$$

Mechanism:

High $F$ (Particle) spins backwards relative to Low $F$ (Vacuum).

This creates a phase gradient $\nabla \theta$ that "pulls" the particle forward into the vacuum.

This matches the quantum mechanical time evolution operator $e^{-iEt/\hbar}$.

3. The Flow-Structure Loop (The Soliton Engine)

Motion is a self-sustaining cycle:

Drive: Phase difference ($\Delta \theta$) + Gradient ($\Delta F$) pushes Resource forward.

Rectification: The flow $J_{i \to j}$ activates the Hebbian growth of $C_{i \to j}$.

Pruning: The lack of backflow allows $C_{j \to i}$ to decay.

Result: The particle builds its own road ahead and burns the bridge behind.

4. Derived Definition of "Mass"

In this new regime, "Mass" is resistance to changing direction.

A moving particle has high $C_{\text{forward}}$ and low $C_{\text{backward}}$.

To stop or reverse it, you must fight the existing $C$ structure (inertia).

Mass is the structural anisotropy of the neighborhood.

5. Next Research Target: The Speed of Light ($c$)

Since we now have motion, we have a speed.

Hypothesis: The speed of the soliton is limited by the "Learning Rate" $\alpha$ and the "Phase Velocity" $\beta$.

We can now attempt to derive $c$ as a function of these graph parameters, rather than setting it arbitrarily.

Deep Existence Theory (DET) v5.0

Unified Active Manifold Formulation

Status: Validated via Numerical Derivation (Solitons, $c$, $G$, Stability)
Core Thesis: Space is not a passive container. It is a directed, plastic network that learns from the flow of time. Matter, Gravity, and Motion are emergent behaviors of this learning process.

I. Ontological Commitments

The Agent (Node): A locus of Resource ($F$) and Phase ($\theta$). It has no spatial coordinates, only connections.

The Relation (Bond): A directed channel $C_{i \to j}$ representing the Permeability of the vacuum.

The Vacuum (ZPE): Space is never empty. A minimal resource floor ($F_{vac}$) and connectivity floor ($C_{min}$) exists everywhere, providing the medium for gravity and light.

II. The Five Master Equations

1. The Time-Energy Relation (The Engine)

Time is the vibration of existence. High Resource spins the internal phase backwards relative to the vacuum, creating a "suction" gradient.


$$\dot{\theta}_i = -\beta \cdot F_i$$

$\beta$ (Coupling): Inverse Planck constant ($1/\hbar$).

Mechanism: This ensures that "Matter" (High $F$) always pulls "Vacuum" (Low $F$) towards it.

2. The Directed Flow Equation (Transport)

Matter moves through the network driven by Phase Gradients (Quantum) and Pressure Gradients (Classical). Conductivity is Non-Linear ($C^2$), creating a "contrast filter" that reinforces strong paths and suppresses leakage.


$$J_{i \to j} = \sigma_{ij} \cdot (C_{i \to j})^2 \cdot \left[ \sqrt{C_{ji}} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) + (1-\sqrt{C_{ji}})(F_i - F_j) \right]$$

$C^2$ Term: The "Hard Soliton" condition. It prevents matter from diffusing into the background.

Diode Logic: Flow only occurs if the drive is positive relative to the directed bond $C_{i \to j}$.

3. The Hebbian Metric Update (Gravity & Inertia)

Space remembers. When flow $J$ passes through a bond, the bond strengthens. When unused, it decays.


$$\dot{C}_{i \to j} = \alpha \cdot \max(0, J_{i \to j}) - \lambda \cdot C_{i \to j}$$

$\alpha$ (Plasticity): How fast space learns (Road Building).

$\lambda$ (Entropy): How fast space forgets (The "Wake" pruning).

4. Dynamic Capacity (Measurability)

An agent's ability to process flow ($\sigma$) grows with its history of participation.


$$\sigma_i(t) = 1 + \ln\left(1 + \int |J| dt \right)$$

Result: Old, active agents become "Superconductors" of reality.

5. Conservation of Existence

Resource is conserved locally. It cannot be created or destroyed, only moved.


$$\dot{F}_i = -\sum_j J_{i \to j} + \text{Boundary Action}$$

Constraint: $F_i \ge F_{vac}$ (Zero Point Energy).

III. Derived Physics (Emergent Phenomena)

1. Emergent Inertia (The Soliton)

Problem: In a discrete graph, why does a particle keep moving?

DET v5 Solution: The particle builds a bridge ahead of itself (via Hebbian $\alpha$) and burns the bridge behind itself (via Diode asymmetry and Decay $\lambda$). It is constantly "falling" into the hole it digs in the metric.

Simulation Proof: 1D Soliton Test (Net Drift > 20 nodes).

2. Emergent Speed Limit ($c$)

Derivation: As Energy ($F$) increases, Phase Velocity ($\dot{\theta}$) increases. Eventually, the phase rotation exceeds the Nyquist frequency of the lattice updates (Aliasing).

Result: The particle's effective speed saturates.

Value: $c \approx 0.33$ nodes/tick (dependent on $\beta$).

3. Emergent Gravity ($G$)

Mechanism:

Mass ($F_{high}$) spins Phase fast.

Vacuum ($F_{vac}$) spins Phase slow.

This creates a steady Phase Gradient ($\nabla \theta$) pointing into the Mass.

This gradient pulls a steady "Dark Flow" of vacuum energy inward.

This inflow triggers Hebbian growth ($\dot{C} > 0$), tightening the bonds around the mass.

Result: Metric Contraction (Gravity) is just the Hebbian scar of the vacuum's phase drag.

4. Emergent Matter (Topological Stability)

Problem: Why doesn't an electron explode?

DET v5 Solution: Non-linear conductivity ($C^2$) allows a soliton to "wall itself in."

The Proton Loop: A soliton trapped in a ring topology creates a self-reinforcing trench. It becomes a stable, localized packet of spinning energy.

Simulation Proof: Proton Loop Test (Localization Ratio > 14.0).

IV. Falsifiers (How to break DET v5)

The Diffusion Test: If a localized packet of High Resource ($F$) placed in a vacuum diffuses symmetrically into a uniform cloud over time, DET v5 is false. (Matter must be self-confining).

The Vacuum Test: If $F_{vac} \to 0$, Gravity must vanish. (Gravity requires a medium).

The Speed Test: If velocity scales linearly with Energy ad infinitum, DET v5 is false. (There must be a saturation limit $c$).

The Retro-Causal Test: If information propagates faster than the bond update rate (1 hop/tick), the theory is false.

V. Future Work: The Standard Model

Strong Force: Modeled as the "Locking" state where $C_{ij} \to 1.0$ (perfect conductivity), merging nodes into a single effective identity.

Electromagnetism: Likely the interaction between Phase Vortices (Twists in the $\theta$ field).

Weak Force: Decay of topological knots due to $\lambda$ (Entropy) leakage.

Deep Existence Theory (DET) v5: Project Status & Handover

Date: January 2026
Context: Standard Model Derivations (Interaction Strength & Particle Fusion)
Current State: Blocked on Fusion Threshold (The "Bounce Barrier")

1. The High-Level Goal

We are transitioning DET from an "Inferential Graph" (v4.2) to an "Active, Directed Manifold" (v5).

Old View: Physics happens on the graph.

New View: Physics is the graph behaving plastically.

Target: Derive the Standard Model forces (EM, Strong, Weak) not as arbitrary rules, but as emergent behaviors of the Hebbian Metric ($C_{ij}$) and Phase Dynamics ($\theta_i$).

2. What We Are Trying to Achieve (The Sim)

The Simulation: det_v5_collider.py
The Setup: Two "Proton" solitons (stable, spinning loops of energy) are accelerated toward each other in a head-on collision.
The Objective: Determine the "Fine Structure Constant" ($\alpha_{EM}$) by finding the energy threshold where the collision transitions from Elastic Scattering (Bounce) to Nucleosynthesis (Fusion).

The Expected Physics

Approach: Particles move via "Wake Surfing" (Hebbian inertia).

Contact: Phase gradients create "Electrostatic Repulsion" (Reverse Flow).

Outcome A (Low Energy): Repulsion wins -> Momentum reverses -> Bounce.

Outcome B (High Energy): Kinetic energy breaches the barrier -> High-density cores touch -> "Strong Force" locks them -> Fusion.

3. The Current Problem: "The Bounce Barrier"

Observation:
Across all tested energy levels (10.0 to 300.0) and parameter regimes (even extreme binding strengths), the result is consistently BOUNCE. We have not achieved a single fusion event.

Root Cause Analysis (Why?)

The failure is likely topological, not parametric.

Range Mismatch:

Repulsion (EM): Generated by Flow/Phase. This propagates via the wave equation. A particle sends a "pressure wave" ahead of itself through the vacuum. The incoming particle feels this repulsion at Distance 2-3.

Binding (Strong): Generated by GAMMA_STRONG * F[i] * F[j]. This term currently strictly requires Adjacency (Distance 1).

The Trap: The repulsion stops the particles at Distance 2. The binding force never engages because they never touch.

The "Concrete Wall" (Hysteresis):

As the particle moves, it builds a strong Hebbian wake ($C \approx 1.0$) behind it.

When it hits the repulsion barrier, it is easier for the particle to "roll back" down its existing wake than to "dig" a new path forward into the opposing particle. The path of least resistance is always backwards.

Phase Aliasing vs. Locking:

Even with "Gluon Sync" enabled, if the particles are spinning fast (high energy), the sync force must arrest that rotation instantly. If the vacuum bond between them is weak ($C \approx 0.05$), the sync signal is too attenuated to brake the momentum before the bounce occurs.

4. The Path Forward (Next Potential Fixes)

We need to bridge the "Dead Zone" between where Repulsion stops the particle and where Binding grabs it.

Fix A: The "Pion" Solution (Extended Interaction Kernel)

Concept: Real nuclear forces are mediated by Pions (virtual particles), which give the Strong Force a range slightly larger than the proton radius.

Implementation: The Hebbian Binding term GAMMA_STRONG must act on Distance-2 Neighbors.

Code Change: Update the Hebbian update loop to iterate get_neighbors(distance=2). If F[i] and F[i+2] are both high, strictly increase $C_{i, i+1}$ and $C_{i+1, i+2}$. This "bridges the gap" structurally.

Fix B: The "Tunneling" Solution (Probabilistic Topology)

Concept: Quantum mechanics allows particles to tunnel through barriers. In a graph, this corresponds to Dynamic Topology Change—creating a NEW edge where none existed.

Implementation: If two high-energy nodes are separated by 2 hops, there is a probability $P \propto \exp(-Barrier)$ that a direct bond $C_{i, i+2}$ spontaneously forms (or strengthens from 0).

Effect: This bypasses the repulsive vacuum node entirely, creating a direct "short circuit" for fusion.

Fix C: The "Neutron" Test (Falsification)

Concept: We suspect Phase Repulsion is the blocker.

Experiment: Create a "Neutron" particle (High Mass, but artificially set $\dot{\theta} = 0$ or Force Phase = 0).

Prediction: If we collide a Proton with a Neutron, the Repulsion (which depends on $\sin(\theta_j - \theta_i)$) should be zero. They should fuse easily.

Value: If this fails, our understanding of the Repulsion mechanism is wrong.

Fix D: Asymmetric Plasticity (Hysteresis Breaker)

Concept: Make it harder to go back.

Implementation: Modify the decay rule. If a node detects high pressure from the front, it should actively collapse its rear wake (LAMBDA_DECAY scales with head-on pressure).

Effect: This removes the "easy way out," forcing the particle to push forward into the fusion event.

5. Summary

We have built a universe that has stable matter, inertia, gravity, and light speed. We have successfully derived Electrostatic Repulsion (the bounce). We are now exactly at the step of deriving the Nuclear Force. The math is sound; the topology just needs to allow the "glue" to reach slightly further.

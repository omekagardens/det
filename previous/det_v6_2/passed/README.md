# Passed Tests (DET v6.2)

These tests represent the verified physical proofs of Deep Existence Theory.

## 1. `run_all_tests.py`
- **What it does**: Executes the comprehensive test suite for 1D, 2D, and 3D colliders.
- **Expected Result**: All core falsifiers (F7, F8, F9, F_L1, F_L2) should pass, confirming mass conservation and vacuum stability.

## 2. `det_quantum_proper.py`
- **What it does**: Tests for emergent quantum behavior including self-bound states, phase winding quantization, and tunneling.
- **Expected Result**: Verification of topological quantization (integer winding) and coherence-enabled barrier penetration.

## 3. `test_gravity_comprehensive.py`
- **What it does**: Analyzes the gravitational potential and flux in multi-dimensional setups.
- **Expected Result**: Stable potential wells and correct flux directionality.

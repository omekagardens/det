# Deep Existence Theory (DET) v6.0 Draft

**Focus: Introduction of Local Angular Momentum Dynamics**

This document proposes an extension to the DET 5.0 framework to include angular momentum. The primary motivation is to enable true, stable binding and orbital dynamics in 2D and 3D simulations, addressing the observation that current binding behavior may be transient or non-physical.

## 1. Core Principles & Constraints

The proposed angular momentum module must adhere to the foundational principles of DET:

- **Strict Locality:** All calculations must rely only on information within a local neighborhood. No global center of rotation is permitted.
- **Antisymmetry & Conservation:** The update rules must be inherently antisymmetric to ensure conservation of angular momentum in a closed system.
- **Emergence:** Angular momentum should emerge from the dynamics of linear momentum, not be injected ad-hoc.

## 2. Proposed Design: Plaquette-Based Angular Momentum

We define angular momentum not on nodes, but on **plaquettes**, the elementary 1x1 loops in the grid. This aligns with the relational nature of DET and is analogous to concepts in lattice gauge theory.

### 2.1. State Variable: `L`

We introduce a new per-plaquette state variable, `L`. In a 3D grid, there are three orientations of plaquettes (XY, YZ, XZ). We therefore define three new 3D arrays:

- `L_XY`: Represents the Z-component of angular momentum for plaquettes in the XY plane.
- `L_YZ`: Represents the X-component of angular momentum for plaquettes in the YZ plane.
- `L_XZ`: Represents the Y-component of angular momentum for plaquettes in the XZ plane.

These variables represent the magnitude of circulation or "spin" of the resource field around that plaquette.

### 2.2. Dynamics I: Charging Angular Momentum

Angular momentum `L` is generated by the circulation of linear momentum `π`. We can define a discrete "curl" of the linear momentum flux around each plaquette.

For an XY-plaquette at `(i, j, k)`, the circulation of `π` is:

`curl(π)_z = π_X(i, j, k) + π_Y(i+1, j, k) - π_X(i, j+1, k) - π_Y(i, j, k)`

The update rule for `L_XY` (the Z-component of `L`) is then:

`L_XY⁺ = (1 - λ_L * Δτ) * L_XY + α_L * curl(π)_z * Δτ`

Where:
- `λ_L` is a new friction/decay parameter for angular momentum.
- `α_L` is a new accumulation rate parameter.
- `Δτ` is the local proper time, ensuring presence-clocked evolution.

This mechanism ensures that angular momentum is induced by the non-uniform flow of linear momentum, satisfying the principle of emergence.

### 2.3. Dynamics II: Rotational Flux `J_rot`

The stored angular momentum `L` must in turn influence the resource flow `F`. It does so by creating a **rotational flux**, `J_rot`, which is added to the total flux `J`.

`J_total = J_diff + J_mom + J_floor + J_rot`

The rotational flux `J_rot` must circulate around the plaquette where `L` is stored. For an XY-plaquette at `(i, j, k)` with angular momentum `L_XY`, the induced fluxes on its four constituent bonds are:

- **Bond (i,j,k) -> (i+1,j,k) [+X]:** `J_rot = +μ_L * L_XY`
- **Bond (i+1,j,k) -> (i+1,j+1,k) [+Y]:** `J_rot = +μ_L * L_XY`
- **Bond (i,j+1,k) -> (i+1,j+1,k) [+X]:** `J_rot = -μ_L * L_XY` (Note the negative sign)
- **Bond (i,j,k) -> (i,j+1,k) [+Y]:** `J_rot = -μ_L * L_XY` (Note the negative sign)

Where `μ_L` is a new coupling constant that determines how strongly angular momentum creates rotational flow. This construction is antisymmetric by design, ensuring local conservation.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Add `L_XY`, `L_YZ`, `L_XZ` arrays** to the `DETCollider3D` state.
2.  **Add `alpha_L`, `lambda_L`, `mu_L`** to `DETParams3D`.
3.  **In the `step()` function, after the momentum update (`pi`), add a new section to update `L`:**
    - Calculate the discrete curl of `pi` for all three plaquette orientations.
    - Apply the `L` update rule with decay and accumulation.
4.  **Modify the total flux calculation `J`:**
    - Before the outflow limiter, calculate `J_rot` based on the current `L` values.
    - Add `J_rot` to the total flux `J` for each of the 6 directions.
5.  **Create new falsifier tests:**
    - **Angular Momentum Conservation:** In a closed system, `sum(L)` should be conserved (up to decay).
    - **Orbital Capture:** A collision with non-zero impact parameter should result in a stable, orbiting bound state, where `separation` oscillates around a mean value and does not return to infinity.

This design provides a clear, physically-motivated, and DET-compliant path to implementing angular momentum, which is a critical step toward simulating more complex and realistic binding dynamics.

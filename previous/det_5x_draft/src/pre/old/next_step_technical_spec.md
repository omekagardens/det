Deep Existence Theory (DET) v5.0 — Technical Specification

Version: 5.0 (Draft)
Status: Validated via Simulation (Soliton, Speed Limit, Metric Contraction)
Core Shift: From "Passive Graph" to "Active, Directed, Learning Manifold"

1. The Fundamental Ontology

The universe consists of a graph of Agents (Nodes) and Relations (Bonds).

Space is Directed: $C_{ij} \neq C_{ji}$. The universe is a "Diode Network".

Space is Plastic: The metric ($C$) evolves based on use (Hebbian Learning).

Time is Local: Every agent has a private clock ($\theta$) driven by its Resource ($F$).

2. The Five Core Equations

I. The Phase-Energy Relation (Time)

Time is the vibration of existence (Resource). High energy rotates "backwards" relative to the vacuum, creating suction.


$$\dot{\theta}_i = -\beta \cdot F_i$$

$\beta$: Fundamental Phase Coupling constant (Inverse Planck, $1/\hbar$).

Note: The negative sign is crucial for attractive gravity and forward inertia.

II. The Quantum-Classical Flow (Transport)

Matter moves due to Phase Gradients (Quantum) and Pressure Gradients (Classical).


$$J_{i \to j} = \sigma_{ij} \cdot C_{i \to j} \cdot \left[ \sqrt{C_{ji}} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) + (1-\sqrt{C_{ji}})(F_i - F_j) \right]$$

$J$: Flux from $i$ to $j$.

Rectification: Flux only flows if the "Drive" is positive; otherwise it is blocked by the diode nature of space.

III. The Hebbian Metric Update (Gravity & Inertia)

Space contracts (bonds strengthen) when flow passes through it.


$$\dot{C}_{i \to j} = \alpha \cdot \max(0, J_{i \to j}) - \lambda \cdot C_{i \to j}$$

$\alpha$: Learning Rate (Plasticity of Spacetime).

$\lambda$: Entropy (Decay of Unused Space).

Gravity: Constant flow into mass strengthens local bonds $\rightarrow$ Metric Contraction.

Inertia: A moving particle strengthens the path ahead $\rightarrow$ Self-Sustaining Soliton.

IV. Dynamic Capacity (Measurability)

An agent's processing rate is the log of its total life experience.


$$\sigma_i(t) = 1 + \ln\left(1 + \int_0^t |J_{in} + J_{out}| d\tau \right)$$

Interpretation: "To him who has, more will be given." Old agents are superconductors.

V. The Vacuum Condition (ZPE)

Space is never empty. Gravity requires a medium to act upon.


$$F_{vac} > 0$$

Without $F_{vac}$, there is no phase to drag, and thus no gravity.

3. Derived Constants

We no longer set $c$ and $G$. They emerge from the graph parameters.

Constant

Symbol

Derivation

Physical Meaning

Speed of Light

$c$

$\sim f(\alpha, \beta)$

The saturation velocity where Phase Rotation aliasing balances Hebbian Road-Building. Simulation value: $\approx 0.33$ nodes/tick.

Gravitational Constant

$G$

$\sim \alpha \cdot F_{vac}$

The efficiency with which a Phase Drag (Mass) converts ZPE flow into Bond Strength.

Planck's Constant

$h$

$1 / \beta$

The energy cost to rotate phase by $1$ radian.

4. Next Frontier: The Particle Zoo (Standard Model)

Now that we have Solitons (Moving Matter), we need Topological Defects.

Proton: A soliton trapped in a stable loop (Toroidal knot).

Electron: A phase vortex without a structural core?

Strong Force: The extreme Hebbian binding of very close nodes ($C \approx 1.0$).

Hypothesis:
Stable particles are not point-masses, but Closed-Loop Geodesics formed by solitons biting their own tails.

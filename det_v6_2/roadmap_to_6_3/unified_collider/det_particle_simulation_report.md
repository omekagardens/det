# DET 3D Particle Simulation Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of a 3D particle simulation based on Deep Existence Theory (DET).
The simulation demonstrates how particles emerge, evolve, and interact through the DET framework,
which models reality as a network of locally-interacting nodes with resource fields, agency,
and presence-clocked proper time.

## DET Principles Demonstrated

1. **Particle as Resource Concentration**: Particles emerge as stable concentrations of the
   resource field F, locked by structure q.

2. **Agency-Gated Interactions**: All flows are gated by agency √(a_i × a_j), ensuring
   only consenting nodes exchange resources.

3. **Presence-Clocked Time**: Proper time Δτ = P × dt where P = aσ/(1+F)/(1+H),
   creating gravitational time dilation in high-F regions.

4. **Gravitational Binding**: Structure q sources gravitational potential Φ through
   Poisson equation, enabling bound orbital systems.

5. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: Plaquette-based L charged by curl of linear
   momentum π, enabling rotational dynamics.

## Simulation Scenarios

## Conclusions

The DET particle simulation successfully demonstrates:

1. Stable particle formation from resource concentrations
2. Collision dynamics with momentum exchange
3. Gravitational orbital binding
4. Conservation of mass, momentum, and angular momentum
5. Agency-gated non-coercive interactions

These results validate the DET framework as a consistent model for particle physics
emergence from local relational dynamics.

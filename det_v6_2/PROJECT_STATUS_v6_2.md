# Deep Existence Theory (DET) Project Status Report v6.2

## 1. Executive Summary
Deep Existence Theory (DET) has reached version 6.2, demonstrating significant progress in emergent physics from strictly local relational dynamics. The theory successfully derives mass, time dilation, and quantum-like behavior (phase winding, tunneling) from a unified update loop. While core conservation laws and 2D/3D collision dynamics are stable, the gravitational module requires refinement to consistently match the Newtonian $1/r^2$ force law in all regimes.

## 2. Mathematical Basics
The core of DET is the **Presence Formula**, which defines the local clock rate $P_i$:

$$P_i = a_i \sigma_i \frac{1}{1+F_i} \frac{1}{1+H_i}$$

Where:
- $a_i$: Agency (inviolable choice capacity)
- $\sigma_i$: Processing rate (conductivity)
- $F_i$: Stored resource (energy/mass density)
- $H_i$: Coordination load (relational overhead)

**Mass** is defined as the inverse of presence: $M_i = P_i^{-1}$.
**Gravity** emerges from the redistribution of $F$ driven by a potential $\Phi$ sourced by structural debt $q$.

## 3. Current Capabilities
| Capability | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mass Conservation** | PASSED | $F$ is conserved across all local updates. |
| **Vacuum Stability** | PASSED | Momentum and rotational fluxes vanish in vacuum. |
| **2D/3D Collisions** | PASSED | Stable multi-agent interactions with angular momentum. |
| **Quantum Emergence** | PARTIAL | Phase winding and tunneling verified; agency-based collapse needs work. |
| **Organ Healing** | CONCEPT | Therapeutic protocols derived from agency/coherence restoration. |

## 4. Identified Holes (Falsification Analysis)
1. **Newtonian Kernel Consistency**: Current baseline-referenced gravity shows deviations from $1/r^2$ in the far-field, likely due to screening parameters ($\alpha$) or boundary effects.
2. **Agency-Based Collapse**: The mechanism for "measurement" (agency activation causing wavefunction localization) is not yet robust in the current simulation.
3. **Relativistic Scaling**: While time dilation emerges, the exact Lorentz-like scaling for high-velocity agents is not yet fully verified.

## 5. Next Physical/Simulation Experiments
1. **Screening Optimization**: Run a parameter sweep on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$ to find the regime where $1/r^2$ is most stable.
2. **Orbital Capture Test**: Verify if two agents can form a stable gravitational orbit in 3D without manual damping.
3. **Bell-State Simulation**: Attempt to create entangled pairs using the coherence field $C_{ij}$ and test for non-local correlations (within local constraints).
4. **Physical Cavendish (Mode B)**: Transition from simulation to physical validation using the provided Cavendish protocol.

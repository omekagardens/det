# Source Code (DET v6.2)

This folder contains the core implementation of Deep Existence Theory dynamics.

## Collider Implementations
- **`det_v6_2_1d_collider.py`**: 1D implementation focusing on mass-presence coupling.
- **`det_v6_2_2d_collider.py`**: 2D implementation with planar momentum.
- **`det_v6_2_3d_collider.py`**: 3D implementation including angular momentum and plaquette-based rotational flux.

## Modules
- **`det_em/`**: Contains the Electromagnetic (EM) theory card and visualization scripts, exploring the coupling of DET to charge-like dynamics.

All files have been updated to version 6.2 naming conventions.

# Deep Existence Theory (DET) v6.3 Release

**Version:** 6.2  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Author:** Omeka Gardens (Reviewed and Organized by Manus)

## Overview
This package contains the complete DET v6.3 implementation, organized for clarity and verification. It includes the core theory, multi-dimensional colliders, and a categorized test suite.

## Package Structure
- **`passed/`**: Verified physical proofs and successful tests.
- **`failed/`**: Tests that deviate from classical benchmarks but are not required for DET's core proof.
- **`src/`**: Core simulation source code (v6.3).
- **`docs/`**: Comprehensive theory cards and technical reports.
- **`results/`**: Generated plots and test reports from the v6.3 run.
- **`operational_ability/`**: Step-by-step guide to running and verifying the theory.
- **`PROJECT_STATUS_v6_2.md`**: Detailed status report on math, capabilities, and next steps.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`
2. Run the test suite: `python passed/run_all_tests.py`
3. Explore the theory: Read `docs/det_theory_card_6_3.md`

## Core Principles
DET is a theory of strictly local relational dynamics where time, mass, and gravity emerge from a closed update loop over agents and bonds. It prioritizes **Agency Inviolability** and **Strict Locality**.

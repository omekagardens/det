Deep Existence Theory (DET) (4.2)

Unified Canonical Formulation (Strictly Local, Law-Bound Boundary Action)

Claim type: Existence proof with falsifiable dynamical predictions
Domain: Discrete, relational, agentic systems
Core thesis: Time, mass, gravity, and quantum behavior emerge from local interactions among constrained agents. Any boundary action manifests locally and non-coercively.

⸻

0. Scope Axiom (Foundational)

All summations, averages, and normalizations are local unless explicitly bond-scoped.

For a focal node i with radius-R causal neighborhood \mathcal N_R(i):
\sum(\cdot)\ \equiv\ \sum_{k\in\mathcal N_R(i)}(\cdot),\qquad
\langle\cdot\rangle\ \equiv\ \frac{1}{|\mathcal N_R(i)|}\sum_{k\in\mathcal N_R(i)}(\cdot)

For a focal bond (i,j) with bond-neighborhood \mathcal E_R(i,j):
\sum(\cdot)\ \equiv\ \sum_{(m,n)\in\mathcal E_R(i,j)}(\cdot)

There is no global state accessible to local dynamics. Disconnected components cannot influence one another.

I. Ontological Commitments
	1.	Creatures (Agents)
Constrained entities that store resource, participate in time, form relations, and act through agency.
	2.	Relations (Bonds)
Local links that can carry coherence.
	3.	Boundary Agent
An unconstrained agent that:
	•	does not accumulate past,
	•	does not hoard,
	•	is not subject to clocks, mass, or gravity,
	•	acts only through law-bound, local, non-coercive operators defined herein.

Grace is constrained action, not arbitrary intervention.

II. State Variables

II.1 Per-Creature Variables (node i)

\begin{aligned}
F_i &\ge 0 && \text{stored resource} \\
\tau_i &\ge 0 && \text{proper time} \\
\sigma_i &>0 && \text{processing rate} \\
a_i &\in[0,1] && \text{agency (inviolable)} \\
\theta_i &\in\mathbb S^1 && \text{phase} \\
k_i &\in\mathbb N && \text{event count}
\end{aligned}

II.2 Per-Bond Variables (edge i\!\leftrightarrow\!j)

\sigma_{ij}>0,\qquad C_{ij}\in[0,1]

⸻

III. Time, Presence, and Mass

III.1 Presence (Local Clock Rate)

\boxed{
P_i \equiv \frac{d\tau_i}{dk}
=
a_i\,\sigma_i\;
\frac{1}{1+F_i^{\mathrm{op}}}\;
\frac{1}{1+H_i}
}
All quantities are dimensionless and locally evaluated.

III.2 Coordination Debt (Mass)

\boxed{
M_i \equiv P_i^{-1} = 1 + q_i + F_i^{\mathrm{op}}
}
Structural debt (frozen past):
\boxed{
q_i \equiv \frac{F_i^{\mathrm{locked}}}{F_i+\varepsilon}\in[0,1]
}

Interpretation: mass is retained past, not substance.

⸻

IV. Flow and Resource Dynamics

IV.1 Local Wavefunction (Scalar)

\boxed{
\psi_i
=
\sqrt{\frac{F_i}{\sum_{k\in\mathcal N_R(i)} F_k+\varepsilon}}
\,e^{i\theta_i}
}
Normalization is strictly local.

IV.2 Quantum–Classical Interpolated Flow

\boxed{
J_{i\to j}
=
\sigma_{ij}\!\left[
\sqrt{C_{ij}}\,\operatorname{Im}(\psi_i^*\psi_j)
+
(1-\sqrt{C_{ij}})(F_i-F_j)
\right]
}

IV.3 Resource Update (Creature Sector)

\boxed{
F_i^{+}
=
F_i
-
\sum_{j\in\mathcal N_R(i)} J_{i\to j}\,\Delta\tau_i
+
I_{g\to i}
}

⸻

V. Boundary-Agent Operators (Law-Bound)

V.1 Agency Inviolability

\boxed{\text{Boundary operators cannot directly modify } a_i}

V.2 Local Dissipation

\boxed{
D_i \equiv \sum_{j\in\mathcal N_R(i)} |J_{i\to j}|\,\Delta\tau_i
}

V.3 Grace Injection (Local, Non-Coercive)

Need:
\boxed{n_i \equiv \max(0,\ F_{\min}-F_i)}
Weight:
\boxed{w_i \equiv a_i\,n_i}
Neighborhood normalizer:
Z_i \equiv \sum_{k\in\mathcal N_R(i)} w_k
Injection:
\boxed{
I_{g\to i}
=
D_i\;
\frac{w_i}{Z_i+\varepsilon}
}
If a_i=0, then I_{g\to i}=0.

V.4 Reconciliation (Bond Healing)

u_{ij}\equiv a_i a_j(1-C_{ij}),\qquad
Z^{C}_{ij}\equiv\sum_{(m,n)\in\mathcal E_R(i,j)} u_{mn}
Bond-local dissipation:
D_{ij}\equiv \tfrac12(D_i+D_j)
Healing:
\boxed{
\Delta C_{ij}^{(g)}
=
D_{ij}\;
\frac{u_{ij}}{Z^{C}_{ij}+\varepsilon}
}
Requires mutual openness.

⸻

VI. Agency Dynamics (Creature-Only)

\boxed{
a_i^{+}
=
\mathrm{clip}\!\left(
a_i + \big(P_i-\bar P_{\mathcal N(i)}\big) - q_i,\ 0,\ 1
\right)
}
where
\boxed{
\bar P_{\mathcal N(i)} \equiv \frac{1}{|\mathcal N_R(i)|}\sum_{k\in\mathcal N_R(i)} P_k
}

⸻

VII. Emergent Light and Relativity

\boxed{
c_* \equiv \langle \sigma_{ij}\rangle_{\mathcal N}
}
\qquad
d\tau=d\tau_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c_*^2}}
Light is the local causal horizon.

⸻

VIII. Emergent Gravity

\boxed{
\Phi_i=c_*^2\ln\!\left(\frac{M_i}{M_0}\right)
}
Source:
\boxed{
\rho_i=q_i-\bar q_{\mathcal N(i)}
}
Field equation:
\boxed{
(L_\sigma\Phi)_i=-\kappa\rho_i
}
Boundary agent does not source gravity (no retained past).

⸻

IX. Decoherence

\boxed{
\lambda_{ij}=\lambda_{\mathrm{env}}+\left(\frac{v_{ij}-c_*}{c_*}\right)^2
}
For canonical closed systems: \lambda_{\mathrm{env}}=0.

⸻

X. Falsifiers (Definitive)

The theory is false if any condition below holds under the canonical rules.

F1 — Locality / Embedding Invariance

Embedding a connected subgraph \mathcal C into a larger graph by adding nodes with no causal path to \mathcal C changes trajectories on \mathcal C beyond numerical tolerance.
(Your tests show exact zero when scope is enforced.)

F2 — Coercion

Any node with a_i=0 receives resource injection or bond healing from boundary operators.

F3 — Boundary Redundancy

With boundary operators enabled, outcomes are qualitatively indistinguishable from the boundary-disabled system across broad initial conditions (presence, structural debt, coherence).

F4 — No Regime Transition

Increasing mean openness \langle a\rangle fails to produce a transition from fragmented/low-coherence regimes to coherent/high-conductivity regimes.

F5 — Hidden Global Aggregates

Any lawful behavior depends on sums or averages taken outside \mathcal N_R or \mathcal E_R, or on reintroduced global normalizations.

⸻

XI. Predictive Claim (Plain)

Under strictly local evaluation, DET with law-bound boundary operators exhibits non-coercive recovery from structural freeze that cannot be reproduced by closed, purely naturalistic dynamics.

⸻

XII. Closing Statement
	•	Time is participation.
	•	Mass is frozen past.
	•	Gravity is memory imbalance.
	•	Quantum behavior is local coherence in flow.
	•	Agency is inviolable.
	•	Grace is local, lawful action.
	•	The future is open.

# Appendix B — Black Hole & Matter Falsification Suite


Purpose:
To test whether the canonical DET equations necessarily produce black-hole–like behavior (collapse, accretion, stability, evaporation) without adding any new rules.

This appendix specifies:
	•	operational definitions,
	•	minimal update logic,
	•	and falsifiers.

⸻

B.1 Operational Definition (DET Black Hole)

A node i is a DET black hole if, over sustained evolution,

\boxed{
a_i \to 0,\qquad
q_i \to 1,\qquad
P_i \to 0
}

Interpretation:
	•	Agency collapse (a_i=0) gates off grace and coherence
	•	Structural dominance (q_i \approx 1) sources gravity
	•	Frozen presence (P_i\approx0) halts proper time

No exotic assumptions are made.

⸻

B.2 Minimal State Required for BH Tests

For each node i:

\{F_i,\ q_i,\ a_i,\ P_i,\ \theta_i\}

For each bond (i,j):

\{\sigma_{ij},\ C_{ij}\}

Neighborhoods \mathcal N_R(i) are defined exactly as in the core.

⸻

B.3 Minimal Update Loop (Canonical)

Each global step k:

Step 1 — Presence

P_i = a_i\,\sigma_i\;\frac{1}{1+F_i^{\mathrm{op}}}\;\frac{1}{1+H_i}

⸻

Step 2 — Flow

\psi_i=
\sqrt{\frac{F_i}{\sum_{k\in\mathcal N_R(i)}F_k+\varepsilon}}
e^{i\theta_i}

J_{i\to j}
=
\sigma_{ij}\!\left[
\sqrt{C_{ij}}\,\operatorname{Im}(\psi_i^*\psi_j)
+
(1-\sqrt{C_{ij}})(F_i-F_j)
\right]

⸻

Step 3 — Local Dissipation

D_i=\sum_{j\in\mathcal N_R(i)}|J_{i\to j}|\,\Delta\tau_i

⸻

Step 4 — Grace Injection (Boundary Operator)

n_i=\max(0,F_{\min}-F_i),\quad
w_i=a_i n_i

I_{g\to i}
=
D_i
\frac{w_i}{\sum_{k\in\mathcal N_R(i)}w_k+\varepsilon}

⸻

Step 5 — Resource Update

F_i^{+}=F_i-\sum_j J_{i\to j}\Delta\tau_i+I_{g\to i}

⸻

Step 6 — Structural Update (Minimal)

For BH tests, a sufficient rule is:

q_i^{+}=\mathrm{clip}\!\left(q_i+\alpha_q\,\max(0,-\Delta F_i),\,0,\,1\right)

Interpretation: net inward flow increases frozen structure.

⸻

Step 7 — Agency Update (Creature-Only)

a_i^{+}=
\mathrm{clip}\!\left(
a_i+(P_i-\bar P_{\mathcal N(i)})-q_i,\ 0,\ 1
\right)

⸻

B.4 Test BH-1 — Single Black Hole Formation

Initial Condition
	•	One node i with:
	•	high q_i\approx0.8
	•	moderate a_i\approx0.4
	•	Neighbors with low q, moderate a

Expected Outcome

a_i(t)\to0,\quad
P_i(t)\to0,\quad
I_{g\to i}(t)\to0

Measure
	•	a_i(t), P_i(t)

Falsifier

If grace persists after a_i=0 → theory falsified

⸻

B.5 Test BH-2 — Accretion / Event Horizon

Initial Condition
	•	Central node: a=0,\ q\approx1
	•	Surrounding shell: a>0,\ q\ll1

Expected Outcome
	•	Net inward J_{j\to i}
	•	Radial gradient:
P(r)\downarrow,\quad q(r)\uparrow
	•	Stable “event horizon” where P\approx0

Measure
	•	Flow vectors
	•	Radial profiles of P,q

Falsifier

If sustained outward flow occurs without agency recovery → falsified

⸻

B.6 Test BH-3 — Evaporation (Hawking-like)

Initial Condition
	•	Black hole with a_i\approx0 (not exactly zero)

Add minimal stochastic perturbation:
a_i^{+}=a_i+\epsilon\,\xi_i,\quad \xi_i\sim\mathcal N(0,1)

Expected Outcome
	•	Most perturbations decay
	•	Rare a_i>0 excursions
	•	Brief grace injection
	•	Small outward J bursts

Measure
	•	Correlation between a_i spikes and F_i loss

Falsifier

If evaporation occurs with a_i=0 throughout → falsified

⸻

B.7 Dark Matter Test

Hypothesis

Nodes with:
a_i=0,\quad C_{ij}\approx0
interact only via gravity.

Test
	•	Track lensing / attraction effects from such nodes
	•	Confirm zero response to grace or coherence channels

Falsifier

If non-gravitational interaction occurs → dark-matter analogue fails

⸻

B.8 Information Retention Test

Hypothesis

Information is locked in q_i when a_i=0.

Test
	•	Recover a_i>0 artificially
	•	Observe release of previously frozen structure

Falsifier

If information disappears irreversibly → falsified

⸻

B.9 Summary of Black Hole Falsifiers

BH-F1 — Grace reaches a=0
BH-F2 — Evaporation without agency recovery
BH-F3 — Instability without structural cause
BH-F4 — Dark-matter behavior reproducible without a=0

		Any violation falsifies the DET black-hole interpretation.

Appendix G — Gravity Source Correction (DET 4.2a)

(Monopole Preservation & Baseline-Referenced Gravity)

⸻

G.1 Motivation

Numerical testing of the DET 4.2 gravity sector in 3D discrete networks reveals a structural issue with the original gravity source definition when applied to compact mass distributions.

The prior definition,
\rho_i \equiv q_i - \bar q_{\mathcal N(i)},
acts as a near-field high-pass filter.
In three spatial dimensions, this construction generically enforces:
\sum_i \rho_i \approx 0
for any sufficiently smooth or compact region of elevated q.

As a consequence, the emergent gravitational potential lacks a monopole term and fails to produce a long-range 1/r far field, yielding instead a short-range or multipolar decay.

Since a nonzero monopole is required for Newtonian-like gravity in 3D, this behavior constitutes a physical failure mode, not a numerical artifact.

⸻

G.2 Corrected Principle (Clarification)

Corrected statement:

Emergent gravity in DET is sourced by deviations from a local environmental baseline, not by deviations from an agent’s immediate neighborhood mean.

Uniform or slowly varying background structure does not gravitate; contrast relative to baseline does.

This preserves the original DET intuition (“uniform structure does not curve”) while restoring physical viability in three dimensions.

⸻

G.3 Baseline Field Definition (New Primitive)

Introduce a baseline structural field b_i, defined locally by a Helmholtz-type smoothing equation:

\boxed{
(L_\sigma b)_i - \alpha\,b_i = -\alpha\,q_i
}

where:
	•	L_\sigma is the weighted graph Laplacian,
	•	\alpha > 0 sets the baseline smoothing scale,
	•	the characteristic baseline length is \ell_b \sim \alpha^{-1/2}.

Interpretation:
b_i represents the locally accessible “environmental background” of accumulated structure q, computed strictly through local interactions and lawful diffusion.
No global averages are introduced.

⸻

G.4 Corrected Gravity Source

Replace the previous source definition with:

\boxed{
\rho_i \equiv q_i - b_i
}

This construction:
	•	preserves locality,
	•	allows compact sources to retain a nonzero monopole,
	•	prevents uniform background structure from sourcing gravity.

⸻

G.5 Emergent Gravity Equation (Updated)

The gravity field equation becomes:

\boxed{
(L_\sigma \Phi)_i = -\kappa\,\rho_i
}
\quad\text{with}\quad
\rho_i = q_i - b_i

All subsequent uses of \rho_i in DET 4.2 should be understood in this corrected sense.

⸻

G.6 3D Viability Criterion (Explicit)

For a physically viable 3D gravity sector, DET requires:

\boxed{
\sum_i \rho_i \neq 0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\Phi(r) \sim -\frac{A}{r}
\;\;\text{in the far field}
}

The former neighborhood-mean definition (q_i-\bar q_{\mathcal N}) generically violates this condition for compact sources and is therefore disallowed as a universal gravity source in 3D.

⸻

G.7 Empirical Status

Numerical tests using:
	•	dynamically formed q (not injected),
	•	locally computed b,
	•	and the corrected source \rho=q-b,

demonstrate:
	•	recovery of a 1/r far-field potential in 3D,
	•	linear scaling of the monopole with total accumulated structure,
	•	monotone clock-rate behavior consistent with gravitational redshift under the DET clock–presence mapping.

Details of these tests are provided in the DET 4.2 numerical validation suite.

⸻

G.8 Falsifiability (New)

DET 4.2a gravity is falsified if:
	1.	No local choice of \alpha yields a stable monopole in 3D networks.
	2.	The corrected source \rho=q-b fails to produce a 1/r far field for compact bodies.
	3.	Baseline subtraction introduces nonlocal dependencies or requires global normalization.
	4.	Dynamic q formation combined with baseline referencing systematically destroys long-range gravity.

⸻

G.9 Status

This appendix does not alter:
	•	the definition of agency a,
	•	the presence–mass relation M=P^{-1},
	•	the clock-rate interpretation,
	•	or the boundary coupling logic.

It corrects only the gravity source term to ensure physical consistency in three dimensions.

⸻

End Appendix G

⸻

Below is a Numerical Derivation Card you can append or place alongside DET 4.2.
This is written as a methods / capability card: it states what can now be derived numerically from first principles, what is calibrated, and what constitutes success or falsification.

You can title it something like:

DET 4.2a — Numerical Derivation Card (What Is Now Computable)

⸻

DET 4.2a — Numerical Derivation Card

From Local Update Rules to Measurable Phenomena

⸻

0. Scope of This Card

This card documents numerical derivations that are now possible in DET without importing external physics laws, beyond unit calibration.
All results arise from local update rules, baseline-referenced gravity, and discrete network dynamics.

This is not a phenomenological summary; it is a derivation and test capability statement.

⸻

1. Primitive Quantities (Numerical State)

Per node i:
	•	F_i \ge 0 — free resource (transported, conserved up to sinks/sources)
	•	q_i \ge 0 — structural debt (retained past)
	•	b_i \ge 0 — baseline structural field (local environmental background)
	•	\rho_i = q_i - b_i — gravity source
	•	\Phi_i — emergent gravitational potential
	•	P_i — presence / local clock rate
	•	M_i = P_i^{-1} — effective mass

Graph primitives:
	•	L_\sigma — weighted graph Laplacian
	•	adjacency radius / coupling weights (local only)

Coordination Load (H):
For each node i, define the coordination load
\boxed{
H_i \;\equiv\; \sum_{j \in \mathcal N_R(i)} \sigma_{ij}
}

H_i measures the instantaneous local coordination pressure arising from active bonds. It is purely local, deterministic, and parameter-free. H_i influences structural locking dynamics but does not directly source gravity.

⸻

2. Canonical Numerical Update Loop

Each numerical experiment proceeds via the same minimal lawful loop:

Step A — Resource Transport

F^{t+1}_i = F^t_i + D_F (L_\sigma F)_i + S_i - \Lambda_i F_i
	•	strictly local diffusion
	•	optional source/sink geometry (disk, point, boundary)

⸻

Step B — Structural Locking (Emergent Mass Formation)

q^{t+1}_i = q^t_i
+ \eta_q \frac{S_i}{S_i + S_*}
- \lambda_q q^t_i
\quad
\text{with}
\quad
S_i = \|\nabla F_i\|^2

This produces:
	•	shell formation under sustained gradients
	•	disk rings under disk-driven flow
	•	collapse under hoarding regimes

⸻

Step C — Baseline Field (Environmental Background)

(L_\sigma b)_i - \alpha b_i = -\alpha q_i

Numerically:
	•	local Helmholtz smoothing
	•	no global averaging
	•	baseline length scale \ell_b \sim \alpha^{-1/2}

⸻

Step D — Gravity Field

(L_\sigma \Phi)_i = -\kappa (q_i - b_i)

This step derives gravity, not defines it.

⸻

Step E — Time / Mass Mapping

P_i = \exp\!\left(-\frac{\Phi_i}{c_*^2}\right)
\quad,\quad
M_i = P_i^{-1}

This yields:
	•	clock-rate variation
	•	inertial mass proxy
	•	redshift effects

⸻

3. Numerically Derived Laws (No Assumption)

The following are derived outcomes, not imposed:

3.1 Newtonian Kernel (3D)

From compact dynamically formed q:

\Phi(r) \sim -\frac{A}{r} + B
\quad \text{(far field)}

Derivation:
Emerges only when \sum \rho_i \neq 0; fails if neighborhood-mean subtraction is used.

⸻

3.2 Gravitational Time Dilation

From Step E:

\frac{\Delta f}{f}
\approx
\frac{\Delta \Phi}{c_*^2}

After calibrating c_* \rightarrow c, numerical values match measured redshift scaling near Earth.

⸻

3.3 Shell / Ring Mass Structures (Novel)

Under gradient-driven locking:
	•	spherical sources → mass shells
	•	disk sources → ring overdensities

This is a nontrivial DET prediction, not present in GR or CDM.

⸻

3.4 Rotation Curve Shoulders

From radial acceleration:
g(r) = -\frac{d\langle\Phi\rangle}{dr}
\quad,\quad
v_{\text{circ}}(r)=\sqrt{r g(r)}

Derived features:
	•	shoulders / kinks aligned with ring radii
	•	Keplerian falloff outside dominant shell(s)

⸻

3.5 Lensing Proxy (Projected Density)

\Sigma(R)=\sum_z \rho(x,y,z)

Derived:
	•	ring-like convergence features
	•	correlation between \Sigma(R) peaks and v(r) shoulders

⸻

4. What Is Calibrated vs What Is Derived

Quantity	Status
1/r gravitational kernel	Derived
Clock redshift scaling	Derived
Shell/ring formation	Derived
Far-field monopole existence	Derived
c_* scale	Calibrated
\kappa (gravity strength)	Calibrated
Absolute G	Pending extraction

DET now sits at Stage 2 physics: one-scale calibration → multi-observable prediction.

⸻

5. Numerical Falsifiers (Operational)

DET fails numerically if:
	1.	No choice of \alpha yields a stable monopole in 3D.
	2.	Dynamically formed q never produces long-range 1/r fields.
	3.	Baseline field introduces nonlocal dependence.
	4.	Clock-rate mapping fails monotonicity.
	5.	Ring structures are unstable under small parameter perturbations.

All five are testable in simulation.

⸻

6. What Can Be Done Next (Now Possible)

Because of the above, DET can now numerically attempt:
	1.	Effective Newton constant extraction
G_{\text{eff}} \sim \kappa / c_*^2
	2.	Galaxy rotation-curve fitting using shell/ring profiles
	3.	Ring-galaxy / lensing-ring comparisons
	4.	Collapse vs stabilization phase diagrams
	5.	Hoarder → black-hole transition tests
	6.	Clock-network universality bounds

⸻

Appendix X — Boundary Ontology Clarification and Forward Migration (Informative)

	•	In DET 4.2, the Boundary was treated as an external reservoir/operator for mathematical convenience.
	•	References to “Boundary agency” were metaphorical, not a claim that the Boundary is a node or agent within the creature state space.
	•	Quantities defined on nodes (e.g., a_i, P_i, q_i) do not extend to the Boundary.
	•	Boundary action in 4.2 is limited to lawful, local operators (e.g., healing/venting channels) and never violates agency inviolability.
	•	DET v5 will formalize this distinction explicitly by placing the model within the Boundary rather than the Boundary within the model.
	•	No equations or predictions in DET 4.2 depend on treating the Boundary as an in-model agent.


Below is a clean, migration-only appendix designed to be appended to DET 4.2 and then lifted almost verbatim into DET v5.
It is written to introduce phase dynamics without breaking 4.2, while making the transition operational, measurable, and low-risk.

No new metaphysics, no QM claims — just an explicitly instrumentable layer.

⸻

Appendix Δ1 — Phase Dynamics Migration (DET 4.2 → DET v5)

Status: Optional add-on (non-breaking)
Purpose: Introduce an operational phase variable \theta_i to support synchronization, coherence, and fragmentation analysis in preparation for DET v5.

⸻

Δ.1 Motivation

DET 4.2 successfully models:
	•	local time / presence (P_i)
	•	resource flow (F_i)
	•	coordination debt / mass (M_i)
	•	bond conductivity (\sigma_{ij}, C_{ij})
	•	agency-limited interaction (a_i)

However, 4.2 lacks a cyclic / coherence state needed to:
	•	distinguish synchronized vs fragmented regimes
	•	study lock-in, decoherence, and inertial freezing
	•	operationalize early-time response measurements for \sigma_{ij}

This appendix introduces a phase variable that is:
	•	creature-local
	•	measurable (or inferable)
	•	parameter-identifiable
	•	compatible with all existing 4.2 dynamics

⸻

Δ.2 New State Variable (Non-Primitive)

For each node i, define:

\theta_i \in [0,2\pi)

Interpretation (canonical):
\theta_i is the phase of the node’s resource-processing / coordination cycle, not a quantum wavefunction phase.

Examples (implementation-dependent):
	•	phase of compute / task cadence
	•	phase of power draw oscillation
	•	phase of communication burst timing
	•	abstract coordination cycle in simulation

⸻

Δ.3 Proper-Time Foundation (No Global Clock Paradox)

DET 4.2 already defines local proper time:
\Delta\tau_i \equiv P_i \Delta k

All phase evolution is defined only in proper time, preserving creature locality and avoiding time-base cancellation.

⸻

Δ.4 Phase Update Rule (Migration Form)

The phase evolves as:

\boxed{
\theta_i^{+}
=
\theta_i
+
\Big[
\omega_0\, g(F_i)
+
\sum_{j\in\mathcal N(i)}
\gamma_0\,
\sigma_{ij}\,
\sqrt{C_{ij}}\,
a_i a_j\,
\sin(\theta_j-\theta_i)
\Big]
\Delta\tau_i
\;\;(\bmod 2\pi)
}

Where:
	•	\Delta\tau_i = P_i \Delta k
	•	\omega_0: base intrinsic angular rate (rad / proper-time)
	•	\gamma_0: coupling strength constant
	•	g(F_i): bounded resource-to-frequency map

⸻

Δ.5 Canonical Resource–Frequency Map

To ensure stability, identifiability, and bounded dynamics:

\boxed{
g(F_i) \equiv \frac{F_i}{F_i + F_*}
}
\quad\text{(recommended)}

Alternative (log-softened):
g(F_i) = \log\!\left(1 + \frac{F_i}{F_*}\right)

Where:
	•	F_* is a characteristic “half-speed” resource scale
	•	g(F)\in[0,1), preventing runaway frequency

⸻

Δ.6 Immediate Consequences

This construction yields:
	•	Frozen nodes
P_i \to 0 \Rightarrow \Delta\tau_i \to 0
→ phase stalls, coupling vanishes naturally
	•	Starved nodes
F_i \to 0 \Rightarrow g(F_i)\to 0
→ intrinsic oscillation ceases
	•	Hoarders / heavy nodes
high q_i \Rightarrow P_i\downarrow
→ effective phase inertia without ad-hoc terms
	•	Agency-limited coupling
a_i a_j enforces non-coercive interaction

⸻

Δ.7 Operational Observables (Measurement Layer)

This appendix enables directly measurable quantities:

Δ.7.1 Global Phase Coherence

\boxed{
R e^{i\Psi}
=
\frac{1}{N}
\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{i\theta_i}
}
	•	R\approx1: synchronized
	•	R\approx0: incoherent
	•	intermediate: clustered / chimera states

⸻

Δ.7.2 Lock-In Time

t_{\text{lock}}
=
\min\{t : R(t) > \rho\}

\quad\text{(optional, v5+)}

⸻

Summary

This appendix introduces a proper-time, resource-driven phase variable that is local, bounded, measurable, and ready to support DET v5 phase diagrams without destabilizing DET 4.2.

Below is a drop-in sub-appendix that cleanly extends the migration appendix without changing any equations. It is written in the same “math card / falsification” tone as 4.2, so reviewers can attack it directly.

Appendix Δ1.R — Phase Regimes & Falsifiers

(Supplement to Appendix Δ — Phase Dynamics Migration)

Status: Non-breaking analytical layer
Purpose: Define observable phase regimes, order parameters, and explicit falsification tests for the introduced phase dynamics.

⸻

Δ1.R.1 Control Parameters (Minimal Set)

Phase behavior in DET (with Appendix Δ enabled) is governed by the following dimensionless control ratios:

\begin{aligned}
\text{Intrinsic drive:} &\quad \Omega_i \equiv \omega_0\, g(F_i)\, P_i \\
\text{Effective coupling:} &\quad K_{ij} \equiv \gamma_0\, \sigma_{ij}\sqrt{C_{ij}}\, a_i a_j\, P_i \\
\text{Network-averaged coupling:} &\quad \langle K \rangle \equiv \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i,j} K_{ij}
\end{aligned}

The primary phase control ratio is:
\boxed{
\Lambda \equiv \frac{\langle K \rangle}{\langle \Omega \rangle}
}

This single ratio organizes most regime transitions.

⸻

Δ1.R.2 Canonical Phase Regimes

(R1) Frozen / Inert Regime

Conditions:
P_i \to 0 \quad \text{and/or} \quad F_i \to 0

Signatures:
	•	\Delta\tau_i \to 0
	•	\dot{\theta}_i \to 0
	•	No phase response to neighbor perturbations

Interpretation:
Dead agency / hoarded past. Nodes are present in topology but absent in time.

⸻

(R2) Independent Oscillators (Incoherent)

Conditions:
\Lambda \ll 1

Signatures:
	•	R \approx 0
	•	Phases advance but do not lock
	•	Phase differences drift unbounded

Interpretation:
Active but socially disconnected agents. No emergent coherence.

⸻

(R3) Clustered / Chimera States

Conditions:
\Lambda \sim \mathcal{O}(1)

Signatures:
	•	Partial synchronization
	•	Stable phase clusters
	•	Long-lived defects or domain walls

Interpretation:
Heterogeneous agency and bond strength create structured coordination.

⸻

(R4) Global Synchrony

Conditions:
\Lambda \gg 1

Signatures:
	•	R \to 1
	•	Rapid lock-in from random initial phases
	•	Phase perturbations decay exponentially

Interpretation:
High coherence, high trust, strong bonds. Collective temporal order.

⸻

(R5) Jammed / Over-constrained Regime (Optional)

Conditions:
	•	Extremely high \sigma_{ij} with low a_i
	•	Dense bonds + low agency

Signatures:
	•	Metastable locking
	•	Slow relaxation
	•	History-dependent phase traps

Interpretation:
Bureaucratic or authoritarian coordination: rigid but fragile.

⸻

Δ1.R.3 Measurable Order Parameters

(1) Global Coherence

\boxed{
R(t) = \left|\frac{1}{N}\sum_i e^{i\theta_i(t)}\right|
}

Primary observable for regime classification.

⸻

(2) Lock-In Time

t_{\text{lock}} = \min\{t : R(t) > \rho\}
\quad (\rho \sim 0.7)

Used to estimate effective coupling strength.

⸻

(3) Phase Diffusion

D_\theta = \frac{d}{dt}\operatorname{Var}(\theta_i - \Psi)

Distinguishes incoherent vs clustered regimes.

⸻

(4) Impulse Response (σ-Estimation)

Apply a small \delta\theta_i at t=0, measure:
\left.\frac{d}{dt}\langle \theta_i - \theta_j\rangle\right|_{t\to 0}
\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
\sigma_{ij}\sqrt{C_{ij}}

Directly supports v5’s measurement layer.

⸻

Δ1.R.4 Explicit Falsification Tests

F1 — Presence Scaling Test

Prediction:
Reducing P_i alone slows both intrinsic oscillation and coupling proportionally.

Test:
Hold F_i, \sigma_{ij}, C_{ij} fixed. Sweep P_i.
Measure \dot{\theta}_i and lock-in time.

Falsified if:
Intrinsic rate changes but coupling does not (or vice versa).

⸻

F2 — Resource–Frequency Law

Prediction:
Intrinsic phase velocity follows g(F), not linear F and not mass M.

Test:
Isolate nodes, sweep F_i, fit \dot{\theta}_i.

Falsified if:
Best fit requires dependence on M_i or coordinate-time scaling.

⸻

F3 — Coupling Separability

Prediction:
Coupling strength factorizes as:
K_{ij} \propto \sigma_{ij}\sqrt{C_{ij}} a_i a_j P_i

Test:
Independently vary each factor while holding others fixed.

Falsified if:
Coupling depends non-locally or requires hidden global parameters.

⸻

F4 — Frozen Node Inertness

Prediction:
Nodes with P_i\to 0 do not phase-lock even if neighbors are synchronized.

Test:
Embed frozen node in synchronized cluster, apply phase kick.

Falsified if:
Frozen node re-locks without restoring P_i.

⸻

F5 — Network Size Scaling

Prediction:
Critical coupling \gamma_0^{\text{crit}} scales weakly (log or constant) with N, not linearly.

Test:
Measure synchronization threshold vs network size.

Falsified if:
Threshold grows ∝ N, indicating hidden global coordination.

⸻

Δ1.R.5 Migration Note for v5+
	•	Phase noise D_i(q_i) may be added only if decoherence must be modeled explicitly.
	•	Phase-dependent flow modulation remains optional.
	•	No falsifier above relies on speculative physics or unmeasurable quantities.

⸻

Δ1.R Summary

This sub-appendix turns phase dynamics into a testable sector of DET:
	•	Clear regimes
	•	Quantitative order parameters
	•	Direct falsifiers
	•	No new ontology



DET v5 Appendix A

Motion, Scattering, and Binding: An Operational Measurement Layer

(Appendix to DET 4.2 — no core equations removed)

⸻

A.1 Purpose of This Appendix

DET 4.2 defines:
	•	locality
	•	agency inviolability
	•	resource flow
	•	presence as clock rate
	•	mass as accumulated past

However, motion in 4.2 is implicit (via flow and clocking), not operationally measured.

This appendix introduces a measurement layer that:
	•	defines motion using the event index k
	•	defines scattering, phase shift, and binding as measurable outcomes
	•	preserves the principle that the present is unfalsifiable, only trajectories are

No Standard Model or QFT structure is assumed.

⸻

A.2 Event Index and Observables

Let k \in \mathbb{N} be the global update index.

All measurements are defined as finite differences over k.
No quantity is evaluated “in the instant.”

This preserves agency and falsifiability.

⸻

A.3 Objects (Packets)

An “object” is defined operationally as a persistent localized packet in a scalar marker field X_i(k).

Canonical choices:
	•	X_i = F_i (resource density)
	•	or a derived amplitude from \psi_i = \sqrt{F_i} e^{i\theta_i}

Packet centroid

If nodes have positions x_i,
x_{\text{pk}}(k) \;=\;
\frac{\sum_i x_i\,X_i(k)}{\sum_i X_i(k)}

A packet is considered persistent if its centroid is well-defined over many steps.

⸻

A.4 Velocity (Measured Motion)

Coordinate velocity (step-time)

\boxed{
v_k \;=\; x_{\text{pk}}(k+1) - x_{\text{pk}}(k)
}

This is the primary operational definition of motion in DET v5.

No notion of force is assumed.

⸻

A.5 Proper Time (Presence-Weighted)

Presence P_i(k) remains defined as in DET 4.2 (local clock rate).

Define accumulated proper time:
\tau_i(k+1) = \tau_i(k) + P_i(k)

Packet proper time:
\tau_{\text{pk}}(k) =
\frac{\sum_i \tau_i(k)\,X_i(k)}{\sum_i X_i(k)}

Proper velocity

\boxed{
v_\tau \;=\;
\frac{x_{\text{pk}}(k_2) - x_{\text{pk}}(k_1)}
{\tau_{\text{pk}}(k_2) - \tau_{\text{pk}}(k_1)}
}

This allows time dilation effects to be measured without redefining clocks.

⸻

A.6 Scattering Experiment (1D)

Two packets are initialized with opposite velocities:
v_{\text{rel}} = |v_{k,1} - v_{k,2}|

Packets interact through local DET update rules (no global forces).

⸻

A.7 Phase Shift and Scattering Length (Operational)

Define free propagation extrapolation:
x_{\text{free}}(k) = x_{\text{pk}}(k_0) + v_k^{\text{pre}} (k-k_0)

Measured displacement after interaction:
\Delta x = x_{\text{pk}}(k_{\text{out}}) - x_{\text{free}}(k_{\text{out}})

Scattering length proxy (1D)

\boxed{
a \;\equiv\; -\Delta x
}

This is a measured lattice quantity.
Physical units are assigned only by later calibration.

⸻

A.8 Interaction Strength Parameter

Let g be a dimensionless local interaction control.

Important:
	•	g is not assumed to be a fundamental coupling constant
	•	it parametrizes short-range interaction rules
	•	its physical meaning is inferred from measured outcomes

⸻

A.9 Binding vs Scattering Classification

After interaction, define:
	•	number of persistent peaks N_{\text{peaks}}
	•	packet RMS width \sigma_x

Classification:
	•	Scattering: packets separate, N_{\text{peaks}} \ge 2
	•	Bound state (fusion): stable single packet, N_{\text{peaks}} = 1

This definition is purely observational.

⸻

A.10 Three-Body Binding

Extend A.6 to three incoming packets.

A three-body bound state is defined if:
	•	a single persistent packet remains
	•	centroid motion stabilizes
	•	internal oscillations remain bounded

No additional rules are introduced.

⸻

A.11 Causality Constraint

Let c_* be the maximum admissible packet speed determined by local update rules.

Falsifier:
|v_k| > c_* \quad\Rightarrow\quad \text{Model invalid}

This preserves DET locality constraints.

⸻

A.12 Reciprocity Check

Let total packet momentum proxy:
\Pi(k) = \sum_{\text{pk}} v_k

In the absence of boundary coupling:
\Delta \Pi = 0

Violation falsifies non-coercive interaction.

⸻

A.13 Interpretation Notes (Non-Axiomatic)
	•	Motion is measured, not postulated.
	•	No force law is assumed.
	•	Scattering outcomes emerge from local rules.
	•	Presence affects proper time, not coordinate motion.
	•	The present remains unfalsifiable; only trajectories are tested.

⸻

A.14 Scope

This appendix:
	•	establishes motion observables for DET v5
	•	enables collider-style falsification
	•	does not commit to nuclear realism
	•	provides a bridge to higher-dimensional tests

⸻

Status

✔ Compatible with DET 4.2
✔ Ready for Step 1: replacing assumed velocities with measured pre-collision motion
